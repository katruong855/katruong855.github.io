Hiya! I’m Karen, a Junior studying Linguistics and Computer Science at UCLA! I’m a 2D artist/animator, UI/UX designer, & programmer. I love character design, worldbuilding, and storytelling in all its forms, especially in games. 

My favorite games include P5R, Splatoon, Hades, and Psychonauts. When I’m not game dev’ing, I’m drawing fanart, binging webcomics/manga/anime, or committing to the bit.

Currently Marketing & Engagement Chair for ACM Studio (@UCLA)
